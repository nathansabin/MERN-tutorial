# Mern Tutorial

## Intro
MERN stack is currently one of the most popular web stacks for a multitude of reasons. Firstly, what is MERN? Well, it's an acronym for MONGO, EXPRESS, REACT, and NODE. Mongo is a NOSQL database; it's very programmer-friendly, and we can turn it into an ODM, which we will see later. Express is a popular frameword in Node. js that allows for simple Restful and GraphQL APIs. React is an incredibly popular framework on the front-end that allows for easily rendering multiple "components".
Node.js is a framework that allows you to create command-line and backend JS apps.


Additionally, it may be worth noting that I will be teaching all of the four main parts out of order; it will make more sense as you start to work in the stack.
This whole project was made assuming that you, the user, already have at least some web development skills. If you don't and you would like to run through all of
In this tutorial, I would recommend learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS.

While looking at the example, you might notice the file structure, which seems a little abnormal. All you need to worry about is everything in the src file.
The index.js file is in charge of loading all of your components and pages to the page; the app.js file is where you put together all of your individual components; and finally, the components file is where you would set up pieces like your header, footer, menu, and other page content.
